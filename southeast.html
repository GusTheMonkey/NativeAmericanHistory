        <h1>Mississippian Culture <span class="date">pre-colonial – 700 - 1200</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Mississippian peoples were advanced, hierarchical farming civilizations that had two main classes: elites and non-elites. The elites were believed to be descended from the gods and were thought to have supernatural powers. Their role was to keep order and control the weather to make sure harvests were successful, which was very important for the non-elites who grew corn, the main crop these societies depended on. Cahokia was the largest and most important Mississippian society, reaching its peak around 1100–1300. These civilizations are thought to have declined because of famines and unrest caused by climate change.

        <h1>Fernando DeSoto's Conquest <span class="date">1539 - 1542</span></h1>
        <p>
            Fernando de Soto was a Spanish conquistador who traveled through the southeastern region of what is now the United States in search of gold. With around 600 men, he devastated many Native populations—raiding, pillaging, spreading disease, and exploiting captives. Some rulers appeased him to secure his passage, while others attempted, unsuccessfully, to ambush his forces. His expedition left the Southeast in ruins, but it ended with his death in 1542, after which his men secretly sank his body in the Mississippi River to prevent the natives from discovering his corpse.

        <h1>Westos Arrival <span class="date">1656</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Westos were a Native American tribe that migrated from northern territories into Virginia around 1656. Like many other tribes, they had a matrilineal society and cultivated corn, beans, and squash. They engaged in trade with colonial settlers, acquiring firearms in exchange for slaves captured during raids on other tribes.

        <h1>The Height of Native American Slavetrade <span class="date">c. 1690 – 1715</span></h1>
        <p>
            At this time, between 15,000 and 24,000—likely far more—captured Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to work on sugar plantations in the Caribbean. They were often worked to death, as it was cheaper for plantation owners to import more enslaved people than to invest in the health or well-being of those already laboring. During this period, exported Native Americans actually outnumbered imported Africans in the colonial slave trade.

        <h1>John Lawson <span class="date">1674 – 1711</span></h1>
        <p>
            John Lawson was an English explorer and surveyor who mapped North Carolina and encouraged settlers to move into Tuscarora lands. In 1711, the Tuscarora captured and executed him, which helped spark the Tuscarora War. His writings give us a record of Native communities and early colonial life in the Southeast.

        <h1>Christoph von Graffenreid Captured <span class="date">1710</span></h1>
        <p>
            Christoph von Graffenreid was a Swiss-German settler who brought a group of immigrants to North Carolina around 1710. His settlement added pressure on Tuscarora lands, which caused more tension among the Tuscarora people. Because of this, he was captured by the Tuscarora, but later was let go.

        <h1>Tuscarora War <span class="date">1711 – 1715</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Tuscarora War was a conflict in North Carolina between colonists and the Tuscarora people. It started when the Tuscarora attacked settlements along the Neuse, Trent, and Pamlico rivers after years of land theft, slavery, and unfair treatment. Settlers, with help from allied tribes like the Yamasee, fought back. Many Tuscarora were killed or enslaved, and survivors fled north, eventually joining the Iroquois Confederacy as the Sixth Nation. The war left Native power in the region weakened and opened the way for more settlers.

        <h1>Yamasee War <span class="date">1715 - 1717</span></h1>
        <p>
            Tensions were rising between South Carolina settlers and the region’s Native inhabitants. Many tribes had accumulated heavy debt from trading deerskins and slaves as well as other goods for firearms, and settlers were also taking over Native lands. Violence was brewing, so Governor Charles Craven sent Thomas Nairne and John Wright to negotiate with the Yamasee (a powerful tribe in the region who led trade with South Carolina settlers). Unfortunately, the talks went badly: Nairne spoke of peace, while Wright threatened the Natives with enslavement. The Yamasee killed the negotiators, sparking the Yamasee War. The Native coalition ultimately lost, and by 1717, the war had ended along with the southeast native slave trade.

        <h1>Creek–Cherokee War <span class="date">1715 – 1717</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Creek and Cherokee nations clashed over trade, territory, and influence in the Southeast. Both nations were trying to strengthen their positions with European settlers, who often supplied weapons and encouraged alliances. Skirmishes and raids disrupted communities on both sides, and many villages suffered loss of life and property. By 1717, the fighting eased as both nations agreed to truces, partly influenced by shifting trade relationships with the British and French.

        <h1>Choctaw–Chickasaw War <span class="date">1721 – 1740</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Choctaw and Chickasaw fought over land and control of trade routes in the Mississippi Valley. The French supported the Choctaw, while the British backed the Chickasaw, making the war part of a larger struggle between European powers. Raiding parties and counterattacks were common, causing widespread hardship for both nations. The war gradually ended in the 1740s when both sides negotiated peace and adjusted to the changing influence of European trade.
