    <h1>Mississippian Culture <span class="date">700 – 1200</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Mississippian peoples were advanced, hierarchical farming civilizations that had two main classes: elites and non-elites. The elites were believed to be descended from the gods and were thought to have supernatural powers. Their role was to keep order and control the weather to make sure harvests were successful, which was very important for the non-elites who grew corn, the main crop these societies depended on. Cahokia was the largest and most important Mississippian society, reaching its peak around 1100–1300. These civilizations are thought to have declined because of famines and unrest caused by climate change.

    <h1>Mourning War Complex <span class="date">pre-colonial – late 1600s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The cycle of cruelty known as the Mourning War Complex was a response to the loss of a community member in a tribe, often due to warfare with rival nations or disease. To restore balance, one tribe would kidnap members of another to replace the lost individual. These captives were often adopted into the tribe, but other times they were ritualistically tortured to death. After the Law of Great Peace, the Mourning War Complex was not committed against other Haudenosaunee nations, though it was still practiced against outsiders.

    <h1>Dekanawidah – The Great Peacemaker <span class="date">unknown</span></h1>
    <p>
        Dekanawidah, called the Great Peacemaker, was a spiritual leader who wanted to stop the constant fighting between the Haudenosaunee nations. He convinced the warring nations to come together under the Law of Great Peace, creating the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy.

    <h1>Haudenosaunee Confederacy <span class="date">1450? – 1650</span></h1>
    <p>
        Somewhere between 1450 and 1650 (or perhaps much earlier), five warring nations established a "Great Law of Peace." This alliance formed what is known as the Iroquois Confederacy, or the Haudenosaunee, meaning people of the longhouse.

    <h1>Illinois Confederation <span class="date">pre-contact – 1600s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Peoria, Tamaroa, and Michigamea peoples formed what became known as the Illinois Confederation (Illiniwek). These Algonquian-speaking nations shared language, trade, and political unity across the Mississippi River Valley. Their villages and farmlands stretched through modern-day Illinois and parts of Missouri and Iowa.

    <h1>Fernando de Soto’s Conquest <span class="date">1539 – 1542</span></h1>
    <p>
        Fernando de Soto was a Spanish conquistador who traveled through the southeastern region of what is now the United States in search of gold. With around 600 men, he devastated many Native populations—raiding, pillaging, spreading disease, and exploiting captives. His expedition left the Southeast in ruins and ended with his death in 1542. His men secretly sank his body in the Mississippi River to prevent local nations from finding it.

    <h1>Pocahontas <span class="date">c. 1596 – 1617</span></h1>
    <p>
        Daughter of Chief Powhatan, who led the Powhatan Confederacy—a powerful alliance of Algonquian tribes in Virginia. She played an influential role in relations between the English colonists and the Powhatan peoples, becoming famous among the English for her interactions with Jamestown settlers.

    <h1>Illinois Visit French Traders <span class="date">1666</span></h1>
    <p>
        In 1666, about eighty Illinois people traveled up the Mississippi River to a French trading post to meet a Jesuit priest. They explained that their people had long been enemies of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), who raided westward seeking captives and control over fur trade routes. This was one of the first recorded diplomatic meetings between the Illinois and the French.

<section>
    <h1>Marquette and the Illinois <span class="date">1673 – 1675</span></h1>
    <p>
        Jesuit missionary Jacques Marquette met the Illinois people during his expedition with Louis Jolliet to explore the Mississippi River in 1673. He was welcomed by the Kaskaskia near present-day Illinois. Marquette returned in 1674–1675 to offer religious instruction and record details about their culture and way of life. During that time, the Illinois village’s population had grown rapidly—reportedly five times larger than before.

<section>
    <h1>King Philip (Metacom) <span class="date">1638 – 1676</span></h1>
    <p>
        Metacom, known to the English as King Philip, was the sachem of the Wampanoag people in what is now New England. At first he attempted to maintain peace with the English colonists, but land loss, cultural pressure, and disputes over authority pushed him into open conflict. His leadership became central to the resistance of Indigenous nations against the English.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>King Philip’s War <span class="date">1675 – 1676</span></h1>
    <p>
        A devastating conflict between the Wampanoag, their Indigenous allies, and the English colonists. It began after years of growing tension over land and colonial control. The war destroyed towns, killed thousands, and left both sides scarred. Metacom was killed in 1676, his death marking the collapse of organized Native resistance in the region. After the war, many surviving Wampanoag were enslaved.

<section>
    <h1>The Beaver Wars <span class="date">1640s – 1701</span></h1>
    <p>
        A series of conflicts driven by the fur trade with European settlers. The Haudenosaunee fought primarily against French-allied tribes (Huron, Algonquin, and others) to control trade routes and access to furs in the northeast. The wars resulted in significant territorial expansion for the Haudenosaunee, but also caused devastating losses and displacement for many Indigenous communities.

<section>
    <h1>The Great Peace of Montreal <span class="date">1701</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Haudenosaunee, along with 39 other Indigenous nations and the French colonial government, signed the Great Peace of Montreal. This treaty ended decades of conflict in the region and established a framework for peaceful coexistence and trade between the signatory nations.

    <h1>Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville <span class="date">1690s – early 1700s</span></h1>
    <p>
        Pierre Le Moyne d’Iberville, a French explorer and naval officer, helped extend France’s presence through the Mississippi Valley. His expeditions established forts and settlements that connected the Great Lakes region with Louisiana, securing French influence in the interior of North America. His efforts strengthened trade networks linking the Illinois region with the broader French colonial world.

<section>
    <h1>Sixth Haudenosaunee Nation <span class="date">1722</span></h1>
    <p>
        After migrating from North Carolina due to conflict with settlers, the Tuscarora nation joined the Haudenosaunee, becoming the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy.
