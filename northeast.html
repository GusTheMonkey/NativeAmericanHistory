        <h1>Mourning War Complex <span class="date">pre-colonial – late 1600s</span></h1>
        <p>
            The cycle of cruelty known as the Mourning War Complex was a response to the loss of a community member in a tribe, often due to warfare with rival nations or disease. To restore balance, one tribe would kidnap members of another to replace the lost individual. These captives were often adopted into the tribe, but other times they were ritualistically tortured to death. After the Law of Great Peace, the Mourning War Complex was not committed against other Haudenosaunee nations, however it was still practiced against outsiders.

        <h1>Dekanawidah – The Great Peacemaker <span class="date">pretty much unknown</span></h1>
        <p>
            Dekanawidah, called the Great Peacemaker, was a spiritual leader who wanted to stop the constant fighting between the Haudenosaunee nations. He convinced the warring nations to come together under the Law of Great Peace. This created the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy.

        <h1>Haudenosaunee <span class="date">1450? – 1650</span></h1>
        <p>
            Somewhere between 1450 and 1650 (or perhaps much earlier), five warring nations established a "Great Law of Peace." This alliance formed what is known as the Iroquois Confederacy, or the Haudenosaunee, meaning people of the longhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term longhouse was symbolic of their unity (and reference to their cultural homes). Together, they formed a grand council of 50 nominated officials (sachems) chosen by clan matrons. Each nation had a unique role:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mohawk:</strong> Protect eastern border</li>
            <li><strong>Oneida:</strong> Eastern mediator</li>
            <li><strong>Onondaga:</strong> Central decision making place</li>
            <li><strong>Cayuga:</strong> Western mediator</li>
            <li><strong>Seneca:</strong> Protect western border</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Pocahontas <span class="date">c. 1596 – 1617</span></h1>
        <p>
            Daughter of Chief Powhatan, who led the Powhatan Confederacy—a powerful alliance of Algonquian tribes in Virginia. She played an influential role in relations between the English colonists and the Powhatan peoples, becoming famous among the English for her interactions with Jamestown settlers.

        <h1>King Philip (Metacom) <span class="date">1638 – 1676</span></h1>
        <p>
            Metacom, known to the English as King Philip, was the sachem of the Wampanoag people and the younger son of Massasoit. At first he attempted to maintain peace with the English colonists, but land loss, cultural pressure, and disputes over authority pushed him into open conflict. His leadership became central to the resistance of Indigenous nations against English expansion in New England.

        <h1>King Philip’s War <span class="date">1675 – 1676</span></h1>
        <p>
            A devastating conflict between the Wampanoag, their Indigenous allies, and the English colonists. It began after years of growing tension over land and colonial control. The war destroyed towns, killed thousands, and left both sides scarred. Metacom was killed in 1676, his death marking the collapse of organized Native resistance in the region. After the war, many surviving Wampanoag were enslaved, displaced, or forced into submission, though their communities endured into the present.

        <h1>The Beaver Wars <span class="date">1640s – 1701</span></h1>
        <p>
            A series of conflicts driven by the fur trade with European settlers. The Haudenosaunee fought primarily against French-allied tribes (Huron, Algonquin, and others) to control trade routes and access to furs in the northeast. The wars resulted in significant territorial expansion for the Haudenosaunee, but also caused devastating losses and displacement for many Indigenous communities.

        <h1>The Great Peace of Montreal <span class="date">1701</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Haudenosaunee, along with 39 other Indigenous nations and the French colonial government, signed the Great Peace of Montreal. This treaty ended decades of conflict in the region and established a framework for peaceful coexistence and trade between the signatory nations.

        <h1>Sixth Haudenosaunee Nation <span class="date">1722</span></h1>
        <p>
            After migrating from North Carolina due to conflict with settlers, the Tuscarora nation joined the Haudenosaunee, becoming the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy.
