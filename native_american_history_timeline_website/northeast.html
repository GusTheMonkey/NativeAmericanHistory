        <h1>Mourning War Complex <span class="date">pre-colonial – late 1600s</span></h1>
        <p>
            The cycle of cruelty known as the Mourning War Complex was a response to the loss of a community member in a tribe, often due to warfare with rival nations or disease. To restore balance, one tribe would kidnap members of another to replace the lost individual. These captives were often adopted into the tribe, but other times they were ritualistically tortured to death. After the Law of Great Peace, the Mourning War Complex was not committed against other Haudenosaunee nations, however it was still practiced against outsiders.

        <h1>Haudenosaunee <span class="date">1450? – 1650</span></h1>
        <p>
            Somewhere between 1450 and 1650 (or perhaps much earlier), five warring nations established a "Great Law of Peace." This alliance formed what is known as the Iroquois Confederacy, or the Haudenosaunee, meaning people of the longhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term longhouse was symbolic of their unity (and reference to their cultural homes). Together, they formed a grand council of 50 nominated officials (sachems) chosen by clan matrons. Each nation had a unique role:

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mohawk:</strong> Protect eastern border</li>
            <li><strong>Oneida:</strong> Eastern mediator</li>
            <li><strong>Onondaga:</strong> Central decision making place</li>
            <li><strong>Cayuga:</strong> Western mediator</li>
            <li><strong>Seneca:</strong> Protect western border</li>

        <h1>The Beaver Wars <span class="date">1640s – 1701</span></h1>
        <p>
            A series of conflicts driven by the fur trade with European settlers. The Haudenosaunee fought primarily against French-allied tribes (Huron, Algonquin, and others) to control trade routes and access to furs in the northeast. The wars resulted in significant territorial expansion for the Haudenosaunee, but also caused devastating losses and displacement for many Indigenous communities.

        <h1>The Great Peace of Montreal <span class="date">1701</span></h1>
        <p>
            The Haudenosaunee, along with 39 other Indigenous nations and the French colonial government, signed the Great Peace of Montreal. This treaty ended decades of conflict in the region and established a framework for peaceful coexistence and trade between the signatory nations.

        <h1>Sixth Haudenosaunee Nation <span class="date">1722</span></h1>
        <p>
            After migrating from North Carolina due to conflict with settlers, the Tuscarora nation joined the Haudenosaunee, becoming the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy.
