    <h1>Mississippian Culture <span class="date">700 – 1200</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Mississippian peoples were advanced, hierarchical farming civilizations that had two main classes: elites and non-elites. The elites were believed to be descended from the gods and were thought to have supernatural powers. Their role was to keep order and control the weather to make sure harvests were successful, which was very important for the non-elites who grew corn, the main crop these societies depended on. Cahokia was the largest and most important Mississippian society, reaching its peak around 1100–1300. These civilizations are thought to have declined because of famines and unrest caused by climate change.

    <h1>Hidatsa Tribe and the Origins of the Crow <span class="date">pre-contact – 1600s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Hidatsa lived along the upper Missouri River in lodges. They were agricultural and traded with many surrounding nations. Over time, a group within the Hidatsa migrated westward into the open Plains. This migration eventually led to the formation of the Crow people. Though they shared language and ancestry with the Hidatsa, the Crow were nomadic hunters.
    </p>

<section>
    <h1>No Vitals <span class="date">early 1600s</span></h1>
    <p>
        No Vitals was the chief who led the Hidatsa westward to become the Crow nation. According to tradition, he received a divine vision instructing him to seek a new homeland for his people.

<section>
    <h1>Crow People <span class="date">1600s – 1800s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Crow emerged from the western Hidatsa migration and became one of the dominant nations of the Northern Plains. They lived in tipis and moved seasonally with the bison herds. Crow society valued honor and spiritual power, which men had to earn. The introduction of horses revolutionized life for the Crow people, and made raiding and warfare more common.

<section>
    <h1>Blackfoot People <span class="date">pre-contact – 1800s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Blackfoot were a Confederacy of tribes who lived on the Northern Plains. They were powerful nomadic hunters who relied heavily on bison (similar to the Crow people). Before horses arrived, they hunted on foot with their entire tribe (men and women) in order to get the Bison to charge in one direction so they could isolate them; afterward, mounted hunting transformed their mobility and warfare.

    <h1>Shawnee People <span class="date">pre-contact – 1800s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Shawnee were an Algonquian-speaking people originally from the Ohio Valley region. They lived in semi-permanent villages and moved seasonally for hunting and farming. The Shawnee became known to the French as the most powerful and fearsome tribe. Interestingly, the Shawnee spanned a great distance across America but remained unified under the same tribal identity.

    <h1>Dakota People <span class="date">pre-contact – 1800s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Dakota are one of the three main divisions of the Sioux Nation, along with the Lakota. The Dakota were semi-sedentary farmers and hunters who relied on corn, wild rice, and game. Their villages and kinship networks formed the foundation of Sioux culture before the westward migrations onto the Plains.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Lakota People <span class="date">1600s – 1800s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Lakota were originally part of the larger Dakota nation before migrating west onto the Great Plains. By the 1600s and 1700s, their lifestyle shifted toward buffalo hunting and warfare (similar to the Blackfoot and Crow). The Lakota established powerful bands that controlled vast territories in what is now the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Montana.

    <h1>Wichita People <span class="date">pre-contact – 1800s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Wichita were an agricultural, Caddoan-speaking people who lived in grass houses across the southern plains. They had a matrilineal and matrilocal society, with women cultivating crops and men hunting. Their political structure was decentralized, and they were known for their distinctive body art, especially among women. It is believed that the Wichita originally lived farther north but gradually migrated to the southern plains.

<section>
    <h1>Pawnee People <span class="date">Pre-contact – 1800s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Pawnee were Caddoan-speaking people closely related to the Wichita. The French referred to them as the <i>Panis Blanc</i> (“White Pawnee”) because they practiced less body art than the Wichita.
    </p>

    <h1>Dekanawidah – The Great Peacemaker <span class="date">unknown / ~1400s</span></h1>
    <p>
        Dekanawidah, called the Great Peacemaker, was a spiritual leader who wanted to stop the constant fighting between the Haudenosaunee nations. He convinced the warring nations to come together under the Law of Great Peace, creating the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy.
    </p>

<section>
    <h1>Haudenosaunee Confederacy <span class="date">1450? – 1650</span></h1>
    <p>
        Somewhere between 1450 and 1650 (or perhaps much earlier), five warring nations established a "Great Law of Peace." This alliance formed what is known as the Iroquois Confederacy, or the Haudenosaunee, meaning people of the longhouse.

    <h1>Mourning War Complex <span class="date">pre-colonial – late 1600s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The cycle of cruelty known as the Mourning War Complex was a response to the loss of a community member in a tribe, often due to warfare with rival nations or disease. To restore balance, one tribe would kidnap members of another to replace the lost individual. These captives were often adopted into the tribe, but other times they were ritualistically tortured to death. After the Law of Great Peace, the Mourning War Complex was not committed against other Haudenosaunee nations, though it was still practiced against outsiders.

    <h1>Fernando de Soto’s Conquest <span class="date">1539 – 1542</span></h1>
    <p>
        Fernando de Soto was a Spanish conquistador who traveled through the southeastern region of what is now the United States in search of gold. With around 600 men, he devastated many Native populations—raiding, pillaging, spreading disease, and exploiting captives. His expedition left the Southeast in ruins and ended with his death in 1542. His men secretly sank his body in the Mississippi River to prevent local nations from finding it.

    <h1>Illinois Confederation <span class="date">pre-contact – 1600s</span></h1>
    <p>
        The Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Peoria, Tamaroa, and Michigamea peoples formed what became known as the Illinois Confederation (Illiniwek). These Algonquian-speaking nations shared language, trade, and political unity across the Mississippi River Valley. Their villages and farmlands stretched through modern-day Illinois and parts of Missouri and Iowa.

    <h1>King Philip (Metacom) <span class="date">1638 – 1676</span></h1>
    <p>
        Metacom, known to the English as King Philip, was the sachem of the Wampanoag people in what is now New England. At first he attempted to maintain peace with the English colonists, but land loss, cultural pressure, and disputes over authority pushed him into open conflict. His leadership became central to the resistance of Indigenous nations against the English.

<section>
    <h1>The Beaver Wars <span class="date">1640s – 1701</span></h1>
    <p>
        A series of conflicts driven by the fur trade with European settlers. The Haudenosaunee fought primarily against French-allied tribes (Huron, Algonquin, and others) to control trade routes and access to furs in the northeast. The wars resulted in significant territorial expansion for the Haudenosaunee, but also caused devastating losses and displacement for many Indigenous communities.

</section>

<section>
    <h1>King Philip’s War <span class="date">1675 – 1676</span></h1>
    <p>
        A devastating conflict between the Wampanoag, their Indigenous allies, and the English colonists. It began after years of growing tension over land and colonial control. The war destroyed towns, killed thousands, and left both sides scarred. Metacom was killed in 1676, his death marking the collapse of organized Native resistance in the region. After the war, many surviving Wampanoag were enslaved.
